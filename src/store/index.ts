  // Let's assume we have a User entity that has a first_name and a last_name
  // in the database. We want to rename the last_name column into surname, without
  // any downtime. If we do everything at once all instances running the old service
  // during the deployment will keep accessing last_name column, generating errors.
  //
  // Instead, to make the change backward compatible we need to split the it into
  // different steps, keeping two assumptions:
  // - We donâ€™t allow database rollbacks. Not doing them simplifies the deployment
  //   process (some database rollbacks are close to impossible like rolling back
  //   a delete).
  // - We allow to rollback the application, as long as application and database are
  //   compatible (Usually one version).
  //
  // Therefore let's assume the following plan:
  // 1.  Deploy version 1.0.0 of the application with v1 of db schema
  //     (column name = last_name)
  // 2.  Deploy version 1.0.1 of the application that saves data to
  //     last_name and surname columns. The app reads from last_name
  //     column. Db is in version v2 containing both last_name and
  //     surname columns. The surname column is a copy of the last_name
  //     column. (NOTE: this column must not have the not null constraint)
  // 3.  Deploy version 1.0.2 of the application that saves data only to
  //     surname and reads from surname. As for the db the NOT NULL constraint
  //     is dropped from last_name. Db is now in version v3
  // 4.  Deploy version 1.0.3 of the application - there are no changes in
  //     the code. Deploy db in v4 that preforms a final migration
  //     for removing the last_name column. Here you can add any missing
  //     constraints.
  //
  // Having this, we can keep track of version incompatibilities, triggering
  // migrations or blocking a deployment when needed.

  // can get a lock, the migration batch will run. If it can't, it will wait
  // until the lock is released.
  // Note that if the process crashes the lock will have to be manually removed
  // in order to let migrations run again. The locks are saved in a table called
  // "tableName_lock"; it has single one column called is_locked that you need
